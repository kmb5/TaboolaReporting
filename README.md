# TaboolaReporting
A simple Taboola reporting using pytaboola - and my first ever git repo

Functions: 
- fetch Taboola accounts using API key
- command-line user input about account, campaign name filter and date range
- create a .csv and .xlsx report with the given conditions

Please note that this is my first ever commit to github, and as a newbie in programming altogether, having been only learned python for around 2 months, my code is definitely not flawless. It works, it saves a lot of time for me, so I thought I would share it. If you find anything that could be made better, please tell me, that is how I'll learn!
